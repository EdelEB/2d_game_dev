# Oregon Trail to Mars
-Edel Barcenas
Pick your crew members and begin your journey to Mars. Who you pick may come in handy later. 
Along the way you will have several encounters to deal with. Resolve them in 
the way that best suits you. However, be careful of crew members hunger and 
morale. There is only so much food to go around.
